# 1. Ask the user to enter their name. Ask the user to enter their
#    age. Assign both of these to variables. Display the name of the
#    user and the year they were born in.



# 2. Use an if statement to output whether a user has a long or short name,
#    given the name they entered for task 1. Use your_variable.size to
#    get the length of a string. When the user's name is 3 letters or
#    under, display "You have a short name". If a user has a name 7
#    letters or longer, display "You have a long name". Otherwise,
#    display "Your name is average sized".



# 3. Ask the user to input a degree value from 0 to 359. Assuming 0 is
#    North, use "case" and "when" to output whether the degrees point
#    Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, or Northwest. Remember that
#    gets.chomp retrieves a string value.
